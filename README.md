## Special Thanks
Special thanks to [0x0ade](https://github.com/0x0ade) for creating [MonoMod](https://monomod.dev/)/[TerrariaHooks](https://github.com/0x0ade/TerrariaHooks) and for creating a fix for SM3. Without TerrariaHooks, Terraria3D would not be possible on tML. 

I would also like to thank everyone who has helped test the mod, report bugs, and being all around chill people. 

## Disclaimer
The mod is still a work in progress. There is more I would like to polish and you may come across some things that are broken. Bug reports are appreciated :D

## Future features
- User ability to define layers and what is rendered on them
