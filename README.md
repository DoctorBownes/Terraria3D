# Terraria3D - Alpha (WIP)
Terraria3D is a mod that adds a little more depth to your world. This mod used tModLoader. The current state of the mod is rough around the edges. I have spent most of my time developing and very little time testing. You'll certainly come across things that don't look right. Please report issues to the issue tracker.
## Usage
Copy mod to mod directory. Requires 0.10.1.5. Terraria3D depends on TerrariaHooks. Install that from the mod browser if it is not downloaded automatically.

Once in game, you need to map the setting window keybinding in the keybinding window. You can use that key to bring up the settings window. 
## Camera Control
- Right click - Rotate Camera
- NUM4 & NUM6 - Move Left Right
- NUM8 & NUM5 - Move Forward Backward
- NUM7 & NUM9 - Move Up Down
## Keep in mind
This is an early version of the mod, the user experience is far from optimal but I would like to start testing core features now.
