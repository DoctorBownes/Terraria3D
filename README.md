## Usage
This mod requires tModLoader 0.10.1.5. Can be found in the mod browser.

Once in game, you need to map the toggle 3D, settings window, and camera control toggle in the controls window.

To move the camera press the 'Toggle Camera Controls' key or open your inventory and click the camera icon on bottom left of the screen.

## Keep in mind
The mod is still a work in progress. There is more I would like to polish and you may come across some things that are broken. Bug reports are appreciated :D

## Roadmap
- User ability to define layers and what is rendered on them
