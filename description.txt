Alpha version of Terraria3D.

Thank you for checking out Terraria3D. This mod has been updated for 1.4 but has issues. It's hard to find time to work on this.

Issues:
 - Crashes with certain lighting modes
 - Jitters if resolution has an odd number in it.
 - Visual glitches if terraria start limiting blocks on screen for high resolution monitors.
 - Reports that the layer sliders currently do not work.

FAQ
Q: How do I move the camera?
A: You can either bind the 'Toggle Camera Controls' hotkey or you can open up your inventory and then click the camera icon on the bottom left of the screen.
Q: This sucks! My FPS went in the toilet! Optimize your mod!
A: I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately the 3D does not come free. You will need a decent dedicated graphics processor to run this mod effectively. There is not much head room for optimization unfortunately.
